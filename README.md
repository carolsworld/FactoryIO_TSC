# Project Title
Digital Twins of Cyber-Physical Systems in Smart Manufacturing: Threat Simulation and Detection via Deep Learning for Time Series Classification

# Project Aim
Our research aims to overcome the limitations of physical testbeds and challenges of data scarcity for Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) model development. 

By leveraging Digital Twins for data-driven analysis, this study proposes the use of supervised DL techniques for accurate threat detection and classification in CPS within smart manufacturing. 

# Overview of the Digital Twins Testbed Setup

This GitHub repository provides an overview of setting up the Digital Twins testbed. The setup guide enables the cybersecurity community to replicate and broaden our methodology, thus enhancing security measures in smart manufacturing ecosystems.

## Hardware and Software Required

You will need the following hardware and software for setting up the Digital Twins testbed:

- [Factory I/O 3D Simulator](https://factoryio.com/) (30-day free trial of Ultimate Edition, the monthly licence fee for Ultimate Edition is €28)

- [OpenPLC Programmable Logic Controller Simulator](https://www.openplcproject.com/) (completely free of charge)

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) for hosting OpenPLC (At the moment, Raspberry Pi 4 is the most stable for OpenPLC, it costs around £60. OpenPLC is yet to work on Raspberry Pi 5 due to dependency on [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi). If you like, you could also use other microcontrollers such as Arduino to set up the PLC simulator with OpenPLC. Another option is using industrial grade PLC, such as those manufactured by Siemens, Allen-Bradley, to replace OpenPLC but it would be comparatively expensive than using OpenPLC)
